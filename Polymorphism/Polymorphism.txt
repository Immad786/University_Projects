     Polymorphism
      - one name and multiple forms
      - eg. Function overloading, operator overloading
      - eg. Virtual Functions
    
    Polymorphism in C++ can be of two types:
    1. Compile time polymorphism
       Compile time polymorphism in C++ is acheived using:
        1.1 - Function overloading
        1.2 - Operator Overloading
    2. Run time polymorphism
       Run time polymorphism in C++ is acheived using:
        2.1 - Virtual functions
